The generic Makefile is used to compile this simple main.cpp file. Typing
"make" should create a "hello" executable in your current directory.

The Makefile uses a Makefile.spec file which can be generated by typing

	"make Makefile.spec"

The Makefile.spec can then be filled to customize the behavior of the Makefile.
In this case, we have set EXECUTABLE=hello to compile an executable named
"hello".

Dependecies are tracked in the .dep directory (which will be created by the
Makefile) and contain the list of files referenced by a given file.  Have a
look at .dep/main.d, you should see all the header files used by main.cpp listed
there.

The file is then compiled to the .obj directory.  You should have a .obj/main.o
file if everything went well.

Finally, since we have defined EXECUTABLE=hello, the object files are linked
together into a hello executable.

You can obtain a summary of what's about to happen when you type "make" by
typing "make explain".
